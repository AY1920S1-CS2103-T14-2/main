== Introduction

T.A.rence is for Teaching Assistants (TAs) who prefer to use a desktop app for managing their TA responsibilities.
T.A.rence is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, T.A.rence can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!



== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `.jar` link:{URL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all students from a given tutorial.
* **`addStudent`**`n/John Doe e/johnd@example.com m/CS2100, tn/Tutorial-01` : adds a student named `John Doe` into the `Tutorial-01` class inside module `CS2100`.
* **`deleteStudent`**`3` : deletes the student in index 3
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user; e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME e/EMAIL`, `e/EMAIL n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Inputs for parameters (apart from student names) are case-insensitive; e.g. `addModule m/Cs1010s` saves the module as "CS1010S" and `m/cs1010s` will subsequently refer to the same module.
* Command names are also case-insensitive; e.g. `addTutorial` and `addtutorial`  are equivalent.
* Longer commands can be truncated; e.g. `delstu`  can be entered instead of `deleteStudent`.

== Enhancements

T.A.rence contains a few input correction features to enhance usability.

=== Autocorrect

If invalid parameters are detected in the command input, T.A.rence tries to suggest similar alternatives that can be selected and run without having to retype the entire command.

E.g. given input

`addTutorial tn/Tut01 m/GET1000 ...`

T.A.rence might respond:

`No such module found. Did you mean: 1. GER1000`

Entering the number 1 runs the command `addTutorial tn/Tut01 m/GER1000 ...`.


=== Autocomplete

T.A.rence generates and displays real-time suggestions for command words and user data from the application (e.g. module codes and tutorial names), depending on the field the user is currently entering.  Similar to other CLI programs such as Windows' Command Prompt and MacOS' Terminal, pressing the "TAB" key will autofill the input box with the current suggestion. Pressing "CTRL" cycles through the different available suggestions.

E.g.: with `addTutorial m/GE` in the input box, pressing "CTRL" changes the displayed suggestion to `R1000`, `Q1000`, etc., depending on which modules beginning with "GE" were previously added to the application. Pressing "TAB" then changes the input box value to `addTutorial m/GE_1000`.
