== PROJECT: T.A.rence

I'm _Kai Zhe_. I'm currently pursuing a major in Computer Science at the National University of Singapore(NUS).

== Overview

T.A.rence is a class management system for teaching assistants in NUS. Designed for the 'super TA',
it tracks all classes taught by the TA and all relevant information pertaining to each class, such as upcoming events,
student participation, assignment scores and the number of hours taught for each module.

== Summary of contributions

=== *Major Enhancements*: added *Model skeleton and ImportTutorialsCommand, Attendance/Assignment/Event-related logic commands*

==== Most of the model classes in T.A.rence, ImportTutorialsCommand, MarkAttendanceCommand and ExportAttendanceCommand, add/delete Assignments and SetAssignmentScoreCommand, add/delete/edit/list Events

* Summary of the features:
** Created most of the model classes used in the T.A.rence application (Modules, Tutorials, Students, etc.)
** Enables the user to record students' participation, tutorial assignments, upcoming events and hours logged for a tutorial.
** ImportTutorialsCommand makes use of NUSMods data to automatically import modules based on the NUSMods url.

* Justification:
** Tracking participation, tutorial assignments, upcoming events as well as compatibility with NUSMods
are essential features that cater to any TA in NUS.

* Highlights:
** Many of the features are interdependent on each other and do not need explicit input from the user
- eg. Tutorial lessons are added to the Events automatically if the semester start date is defined,
so hours logged for each Tutorial can be updated automatically based on the current date.
** The interdependence, while useful feature-wise, also leads to high coupling and it was challenging to maintain consistency within
the different models/data structures.
** The application relies on precached NUSMods data of all existing tutorials in AY 2019-2020, hence it does not rely on a internet connection.
Even then, the loading of the all the data into T.A.rence at initialization is not too computationally/memory intensive, without significant lag.
This is partly because extraneous elements (Lectures, Venues) have been filtered out in the cached data to reduce file size.

* Credits:
** NUS modules and tutorials data was retrieved from NUSMods database {https://api.nusmods.com/v2/2019-2020/}

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Added ability for the user to enter multiple commands separated by the "+" delimiter in a single input (eg. command1 + command2 + command3)
